# Movie-rating-app


This is a simple project, where I used plain React JavaScript and TMDB’s API to create a responsive and interactive movie rating/info website.

Besides React, I used some other  packages that I imported using npm, such as:
-	Styled components for SCSS
-	React router for routing on the website
-	PropTypes for checking property types
The website is fully responsive and ready to use on any modern device.

Explanation of some of the functionalities on the website:
1.	Home page:
On the home page you can see the most popular movie currently (at the time of visiting the website), and also see some of the newer movies. You can search for a specific movie and login in the top right corner with your username and password.

2.	Movie grid:
Here you can see the vast amount of movies to search for.

3.	Search bar:
Here you can type a name of some movie you’d like to see, and the website will interactively look for that movie title, as you continue to type in the input field.

4.	Selected movie:
Here you can see the selected movie that you clicked on. You can see the running time, revenue and the budget for the specific movie. Down below you’ll find the actors that played in that movie.
